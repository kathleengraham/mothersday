                        <p>I am so thankful for you and all you have done for me and my little family. By far, the most important gift you have given us is your obedience to be faithful in sharing the Truth. As a little girl, I remember you sharing with me who Jesus was and how He died for our sins and grants us eternal life with Him. I'm blessed that I feel like I have never known a day when I didn't know that God love me and saved me, and He used you to accomplish this! How special! You have always supported me, encouraged me, and prayed for me. Thank you for always trying to point me towards the eternal! There is no greater gift a mom could give her children than a deep-rooted trust in Jesus and His Truths. Thank you for being my frined, teacher, and cheerleader. My joys are doubled and my sorrows seem less heavy when I share them with you.<br>- Cherie

I couldn't ask for a better wife, friend, helper, and mother of our children. You are truly the princess in my life, and I love you very much!<br>Quote</p>
