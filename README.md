# Happy Mother's Day 2020

Mom,

I have been helping Martial learn to code during this pandemic. It has been great to bond over something new and work through tough problems together as a coding couple. But my first example of a coding couple is actually you and Dad! When joys and trials come, I feel especially thankful for your example as a mom. No one ever had to say it out loud, but I always _saw_ with my own eyes that a woman could do whatever she wanted to do and do it well, even if it's without credit. You are incredible!

So Martial and I somehow decided to make a little website for you. Just a few little things we thought you might enjoy. We love you to the moon and back!

Love,

Kathleen and Martial
